The params folder contains cost matrices for LQ model. Each matrix is stored in a .dat file.

./toyCostMatrix.dat
trained over lqToy.trajectory

./NonRobCostMatrix690.dat
trained over halved trainSet.trajectory. Final total likelihood is about -690

./NonRobCostMatrix790.dat
trained over halved trainSet.trajectory. Final total likelihood is about -790

./NonRobCostMatrix.dat
used as start point

./nonrob.dat
